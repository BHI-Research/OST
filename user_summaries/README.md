# User Summaries

Here you'll find a compilation of user summaries that have been extracted from the following datasets:

- [SumMe](https://people.ee.ethz.ch/~gyglim/vsum/)
- [CUS](https://sites.google.com/site/vsummsite/download)

In the case of SumMe, as user summaries are given as superframes inside a .mat file,
they where first extracted into CSVs and then converted into keyframes using our [Superframes To Keyframe](../tools/s2k/) converter.
